          <p>
            With around two years of experience I have learned and have been
            able to contribute which has helped me grow my knowledge and
            skillset in the field of computer science. During Summer 23, I
            worked as a Software Developer/ML Engineer Intern at Affekta LLC, a
            startup that's focused on optimizing e-learning using Artificial
            Intelligence. Before starting off my MCS at Rice University, I
            worked as an Associate Software Developer for around a year where I
            was exposed to the world of software development where I worked with
            technologies like SpringBoot, MySQL, etc. These experiences have
            been instrumental in shaping my career and fueling my passion for
            technology
